<!-- /VERSIONS -->

**ADHD IMAP Sync** is a lightweight Alpine-based container that combines [goimapnotify](https://github.com/shackra/goimapnotify) and [fetchmail](https://www.fetchmail.info/) to instantly process incoming mail and deliver it to your local MDA (LMTP/SMTP, etc.).

The idea is simple: IMAP IDLE via `goimapnotify` detects new mail and immediately wakes up `fetchmail` to retrieve and deliver it locally. üì¨‚ö°

## üöÄ Quick Start

Example `compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  adhd-imap-sync:
    image: ghcr.io/kriakiku/adhd-imap-sync:latest
    container_name: adhd-imap-sync
    restart: unless-stopped
    secrets:
      - imap_work_pass
    volumes:
      - ./data:/config
    environment:
      TZ: UTC
      PUID: "1000"
      PGID: "1000"

      # Default settings
      ADHD_IMAP_HOST: "imap.example.com"
      ADHD_DELIVERY_TARGET: |
        mda "/usr/bin/maildrop -d %T"

      # Default account (no suffix)
      ADHD_IMAP_USER: "user@example.com"
      ADHD_IMAP_PASS: "SECRET1"
      
      # Extra account with "WORK" suffix 
      ADHD_IMAP_USER_WORK: "work@example.com"
      ADHD_IMAP_PASS_FILE_WORK: "/run/secrets/imap_work_pass"
      ADHD_DELIVERY_TARGET_WORK: |
        lmtp
        smtpname "work@target.com"
        smtphost /var/run/dovecot/lmtp
        # smtphost dovecot/24
secrets:
  imap_work_pass:
    file: ./imap_work_pass.txt
```

### Multiple Accounts

You can define multiple mail accounts by appending a **suffix** (e.g., `_WORK`, `_ME`, `_GMAIL`) to the variable names.  
Each suffix will be treated as a separate account, with its own configuration.  
If a variable is not set for a suffix, it will fall back to the **default account** values (without a suffix).

**Account Name Generation:**
- If suffix is empty ‚Üí account name is `"default"`.
- If suffix exists ‚Üí account name is the suffix in lowercase (e.g., `_WORK_UA` ‚Üí `"work_ua"`).

**Example with multiple accounts:**
```env
# Default account
ADHD_IMAP_HOST=imap.example.com
ADHD_IMAP_USER=user@example.com
ADHD_IMAP_PASS=secret

# Work account
ADHD_IMAP_HOST_WORK=imap.work.com
ADHD_IMAP_USER_WORK=me@work.com
ADHD_IMAP_PASS_FILE_WORK=/run/secrets/imap_work_pass
```

## üìÇ Configuration Files


Fetchmail stores the identifiers of processed messages in the file `/config/.fetchids` (used via the `--idfile /config/.fetchids` option).  
This file ensures that already retrieved emails are not processed again after container restarts.  
You can mount a persistent volume to `/config` to preserve this state:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/config
```

You can provide a `.netrc` file for authentication either by mounting it as `/config/.netrc`.

## üì¶ How It Works

1. goimapnotify connects to IMAP and listens for new mail using IDLE.
2. When a new message arrives, it calls /usr/local/bin/fetchmail-wakeup.
3. fetchmail retrieves messages and delivers them to the configured ADHD_DELIVERY_TARGET.

## üí° Motivation  

I run a self-hosted mail server (**Stalwart**) on my home server. But home servers aren‚Äôt exactly the most stable environment ‚Äî in the last 3 years I had to move 5 times (thanks to one deranged dictator), and sometimes there are internet outages.

To keep my email reliable, I use **MXroute** for both sending and receiving. Stalwart lets me use external SMTP servers to send mail, but I couldn‚Äôt find a way to **pull mail from external inboxes** (would be hilarious if it actually exists üòÖ).  

So, I turned to **Fetchmail** ‚Äî but here‚Äôs the catch: it doesn‚Äôt support **IMAP IDLE** (push notifications for new mail). Instead, it just polls every few minutes. Not good enough ‚Äî I want my OTP codes instantly ‚ö°üì≤.  

That‚Äôs when I found **GoIMAPNotify**, which *does* support IMAP IDLE and can trigger commands when new mail arrives. Perfect match! So I built a **Docker image** that automatically generates configs for both tools and makes them work together.  

Maybe someone else finds this handy too. üôÇ

## üìù TODO

- [ ] Add `tlsOptions` support for `goimapnotify`:
  - `unauthorized` flag (allow self-signed certs)
  - `starttls` support
- [ ] Add per-account mailbox selection support (currently all mailboxes are monitored)
